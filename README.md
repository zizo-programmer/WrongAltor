🔥 Wrongulator – The Evil Calculator

A mischievous calculator that pretends to calculate correctly… until it doesn’t.

⸻

🧠 Overview:

Wrongulator is not your average calculator. It works just like a normal calculator at first glance — but it gives wrong results. Only the cleverest users will figure out how to activate the secret “True Mode” by finding a hidden key.

⸻

🎯 Features:
	•	❌ Gives wrong answers in “Wrong Mode”
	•	🔑 Hidden secret button that activates “True Mode”
	•	🎭 Fake Fix Button to fool the user
	•	⚠ Challenge Mode starts after 5 attempts — user must find the secret within a time limit
	•	⏱ Timer with sound and effects
	•	💀 Audio & visual feedback for success, failure, or confusion
	•	🧠 Traps for overconfident users 😈

⸻

🕹 How It Works:
	1.	User starts calculating — results are always wrong.
	2.	After 5 attempts, they get a hint: “There’s a secret key…”
	3.	Timer starts. If they find the secret button in time — True Mode is activated and calculator gives correct answers.
	4.	If they press the wrong button (like “Fix”) — the app mocks them with evil sounds 😈.
	5.	If they fail the challenge — the calculator shakes, buzzes, and remains evil.
